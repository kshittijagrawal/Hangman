# Hangman
A popular game which you might have played during your childhood phase.  
Also called The Guessing Game, here's a code running "Hangman" in Python with a few modifications to the game.  
PS : This is a "no visual" game and runs without a GUI.  

  
Although rules and restrictions for the game are listed during execution, get a note of the rules in brief :  
=> 2 players at a time.  
=> Player 1 gets to choose a word.  
=> Player 2 gets to guess the word chosen by 1.  
=> Guess can be made an alphabet at a time.  
=> Number of guesses to be made can be chosen by 2.

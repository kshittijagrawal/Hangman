# Hangman
A popular game which you might have played during your childhood phase.  
Also called The Guessing Game, here's a code running **Hangman** in Python with a few modifications to the game, although its more of a Guessing Game than Hangman.  
PS : **This is a "no visual" game and runs without a GUI**.  


Although rules and restrictions for the game are listed during execution, get a note of the rules in brief :  
* 2 players at a time.  
* Player 1 gets to choose a word.  
* Player 2 gets to guess the word chosen by 1.  
* Guess can be made an alphabet at a time.  
* Number of guesses to be made can be chosen by 2.
  
### A snapshot from the gameplay.

A piece that makes the script a bit more faultless is the fact that it is capable of handling almost all kinds of bad input by the user. This probably is the reason for the length of the code.
